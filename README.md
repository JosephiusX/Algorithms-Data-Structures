    1. Ciriculum walkthrough

    2. What order should you watch in

    3. How I'm Running My Code

        Chrome snipit
            inspect > sources tab > Snippets subtab>
                i can run javascript here

sec 2 Big O Notation

    4. Intro to Big O

        OBJECTIVES
            motivate the need for something like big O Notation

            Describe what Big O Notation is

            Simplify Big O Expressions

            Define "time complexity and space complexity of diffrent algorithms using Bit O Notation

            Describe what a logarithm is

    5. Timing Our Code

        the problem with time
            diffrent machines will record diffrend times

            the same machine will record diffrent times

            for fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough
